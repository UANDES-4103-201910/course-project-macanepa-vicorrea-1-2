* For this project assignment (that is not yet implemented the login session with cookies and those things), there are three buttons in the footer that you can use to navigate by the web page, and right next to them you can see the current view. THIS THINGS DO NOT APPEAR IN THE REAL FOOTER. Only appear the AUP and ToS links.
Also you can navigate through guest and regular user views using login/sign up and log out buttons.

* If you see the admin modals incomplete (without titles, user emails, etc), please press ENTER on the url. This is for an error loading the javascript.
